# Phase 3 Syllabus: Flex Program, 40 Week Pace

## Learning Objectives

Welcome to Phase 3! At this point in the program, you've mastered the frontend:
you've gained proficiency in one language, JavaScript, and can use React to make
single-page applications that access data from an API (either on a server that
someone else runs, or on your own `json-server`). You can officially call
yourself a frontend developer! üéâ

By now, you've likely felt the limitation of what you can build without having a
real backend. Fear not! This is the point in the program when that all changes,
and you become **full-stack** developers.

In this phase, you'll learn a new language, **Ruby**, which has some
similarities to JavaScript as well as its own set of unique features that make
it a much beloved language. You'll also learn how to use Ruby to interact with a
**SQL database** where you can control how data is persisted. With those tools,
you'll be able to build out your very own simple backend **API** so that your
next project can take advantage of all the benefits of full-stack development.

By the end of the phase, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Ruby as a language, including principles of
  object-oriented programming
- Understand the characteristics of a relational database
- Perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) actions with a database via an
  Object-Relational Mapper
- Design an API to handle CRUD actions
- Communicate with an API using different HTTP verbs

Use the schedule below to make sure you're working through the material at
the right pace. The lessons marked with a ‚≠êÔ∏è are **milestones** that are useful
to check your understanding of the material you've learned. If you feel you're
falling behind, make sure to communicate with your instructor.

## Weeks 19 - 20

You'll start by learning the fundamentals of Ruby as a language. Transitioning
from one language to another is an important skill to have as a developer (it's
entirely possible your first job after Flatiron will require you to learn a new
language as well), so use this time to get to know and love Ruby.

You should be familiar with all the concepts after having seen them in
JavaScript, so focus on the **syntax** and what makes Ruby unique.

After learning the basics of the language, it's time to learn Object-Oriented
Ruby. At its core, Ruby is a language for **object-oriented programming**.
You've seen some concepts related to object orientation in Phase 1 in
JavaScript; in this phase, you'll explore those concepts in more depth. You also
may find that Ruby makes writing object-oriented code more pleasant than
JavaScript.

Make sure to take your time with the concepts here, and ask for help if anything
isn't clear. Mastering Ruby means building a solid understanding of
object-oriented programming, so the concepts here are key to your ability to
gain proficiency in the material later in this phase and the next.

### Week 19

  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Object-Orientation Fundamentals Quiz
- Topics in OO - Self in Ruby (8)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Self Quiz

## Weeks 21 - 22

You'll finish up with Object-Oriented Ruby, and then get into the next big
exciting topic on your programming journey: databases! You'll learn the
fundamentals of SQL, how **relational databases** work, and how to model
complex data.

### Week 21

**Total Assignments: (25)**

- Topics in OO - Class Variables and Methods in Ruby (9)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Class Variables and Methods Quiz
- (Optional) Additional Practice: OO Ruby (1)
- Topics in OO - Object Inheritance in Ruby (9)

### Week 22

**Total Assignments: (27)**

- Configuring Ruby Applications (4)
- Getting Started with SQL (13)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è SQL Quiz
- Table Relations in SQL (10)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Table Relations in SQL Quiz

## Weeks 23 - 25

Now that you've learned some SQL, next up is connecting SQL to Ruby via an
Object-Relational Mapper, or ORM. You'll start by writing some basic features of
an ORM by hand to gain an understanding of how it works, then you'll be
introduced to the Active Record library, which will make it easier to connect to
a database and run SQL using Ruby.

You'll learn to use the Active Record library as an ORM to connect your Ruby
classes to a SQL database so you can create, read, update and delete data.
You'll also learn how to use Active Record to connect between multiple classes
and establish one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

Finally, you'll learn about Sinatra, which is a great tool for creating small
web servers. You'll need Sinatra to set up the backend for your project, so make
sure to take some time with these labs before beginning the project.

### Week 25

**Total Assignments: (14)**

- (Optional) Scraping (3)
- Web API Basics with Sinatra (11)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Sinatra React Lab: Chatterbox

## Weeks 26 - 27

The time has come for your first full-stack project! In this phase, you'll be
building out a React frontend application once more, but you'll also have
control over the backend by creating your own server using Sinatra that can
handle requests from the frontend, communicate with the database using Active
Record, and send a response in JSON for the frontend to handle.

Details for the project can be found in the Phase 3 Project module.
